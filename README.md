# animate

#### For the (uncommon) case when CSS transitions/animations just aren't enough.

_See the module running at [www.jackieandlevi.com/wedding/photos](http://www.jackieandlevi.com/wedding/photos)!_

This is a general-purpose animation module based on the HTML5 requestAnimationFrame technology.

This app was originally built as part of a photo-viewer web app used to show off the photos from Levi and his wife's wedding.
